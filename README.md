# Playlist
Simple console playlist music app using Java Core with JDBC driver

## General Info
Application is created to improve my developer skills. It's not connected with music files but it's a basic simulation of music media player. It allows to generate playlist from library
of music "files" and manipulate with them using commands like play, skip, replay. Application is connected to database file by JDBC driver
and it's still in development mode. I'm still adding some new features in my free time.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java 9
* SQLite (Library: sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.12)

## Sources
Project based on challange from Tim Buchalka's "Java Masterclass for Software Developers" course on Udemy but going beyond the required task.
